### Relationships (PostgreSQL)

-   `organizations` 1:N `users`: One organization can have multiple users.
-   `organizations` 1:N `chatbots`: One organization can create multiple chatbots.
-   `organizations` 1:N `properties`: One organization can manage multiple properties.
-   `organizations` 1:N `qr_codes`: One organization can generate multiple QR codes.
-   `organizations` 1:N `credit_transactions`: All credit transactions belong to an organization.
-   `organizations` 1:N `api_configurations`: API configurations are tied to an organization.
-   `chatbots` 1:N `qr_codes`: One chatbot can be activated by multiple QR codes.
-   `properties` 1:N `qr_codes`: One property can have multiple QR codes (e.g., for different marketing materials).
-   `chatbots` 1:1 `properties`: A chatbot can be specifically linked to one property (optional).

### MongoDB Considerations (Unstructured Data)

MongoDB will be used for storing data that benefits from a flexible schema and high write throughput, primarily:

1.  **Conversation Logs**: Each interaction with a chatbot will be logged, including user input, bot responses, timestamps, and relevant metadata (e.g., `qr_id`, `user_session_id`). This allows for rich, detailed analysis of conversations without rigid schema constraints.

    **Example Document Structure for `conversations` collection:**
    ```json
    {
      "_id": "<ObjectId>",
      "bot_id": "<UUID>",
      "qr_id": "<UUID>",
      "organization_id": "<UUID>",
      "user_session_id": "<UUID>",
      "timestamp": "<ISODate>",
      "messages": [
        { "role": "user", "content": "Tell me about the property at 123 Main St.", "timestamp": "<ISODate>" },
        { "role": "bot", "content": "Certainly! What specific details are you interested in?", "timestamp": "<ISODate>" }
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "ip_address": "<IP_Address>",
        "device_info": "<User_Agent_String>",
        "location": { "lat": "<Latitude>", "lon": "<Longitude>" },
        "lead_captured": "<Boolean>",
        "lead_details": { "name": "<Name>", "email": "<Email>", "phone": "<Phone>" }
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Raw Training Data**: Unprocessed or semi-processed data ingested from URLs, documents, and images before it's transformed into vector embeddings. This allows for re-processing or auditing of the source data.

    **Example Document Structure for `raw_training_data` collection:**
    ```json
    {
      "_id": "<ObjectId>",
      "organization_id": "<UUID>",
      "property_id": "<UUID>",
      "source_type": "<String>", // e.g., "url", "pdf", "image"
      "source_identifier": "<String>", // e.g., URL, file path
      "content": "<String>", // Raw text content, or reference to image binary
      "extracted_metadata": {},
      "ingestion_timestamp": "<ISODate>"
    }
    ```

### Data Isolation for Multi-tenancy

For both PostgreSQL and MongoDB, strict data isolation will be maintained. In PostgreSQL, every relevant table will include an `organization_id` column, and all queries will filter by this ID to ensure realtors only access their own data. For MongoDB, the `organization_id` will be included in every document, and queries will similarly enforce this filter. This approach ensures data privacy and security in a multi-tenant environment. [4]

## API Endpoints and Data Models

The platform will expose a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend, backend services, and external integrations. These APIs will adhere to industry best practices, including clear naming conventions, versioning, authentication, and proper HTTP status codes. Data models will be defined using a schema definition language (e.g., JSON Schema or OpenAPI Specification) to ensure consistency and enable automated documentation.

### API Design Principles

-   **RESTful**: Utilize standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for resource manipulation.
-   **Stateless**: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand the request.
-   **Resource-Oriented**: APIs will be designed around resources (e.g., `/users`, `/chatbots`, `/properties`).
-   **Versioned**: APIs will be versioned (e.g., `/v1/`) to allow for future changes without breaking existing clients.
-   **Secure**: All endpoints will be protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms.
-   **Consistent**: Uniform error handling, response formats, and naming conventions.

### Authentication

All API endpoints, except for public-facing chatbot interaction endpoints (which will have their own secure token mechanism), will require authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. Upon successful login, the user will receive an access token, which must be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests (e.g., `Bearer <token>`).

## Security Measures and Compliance Requirements

For a $5M+ enterprise-grade platform handling sensitive real estate and user data, security and compliance are paramount. A multi-layered security approach will be implemented across all components, from infrastructure to application logic and data handling. Adherence to relevant industry regulations and best practices will be a continuous effort.

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

-   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Mandatory MFA for all realtor and administrator accounts to prevent unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions will be defined based on user roles (e.g., 'realtor', 'admin'). Realtors will only have access to their own organization's data and features, while administrators will have broader oversight.
-   **Secure Password Management**: Passwords will be hashed using strong, adaptive hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) and salted. Password policies will enforce complexity requirements and regular rotations.
-   **JWT Security**: JWTs will be signed with strong secrets, have short expiration times, and refresh tokens will be used securely to minimize the window of opportunity for token compromise.

### 2. Data Encryption

-   **Encryption in Transit (TLS/SSL)**: All communication between clients (frontend, mobile apps) and backend services, and between internal microservices, will be encrypted using TLS/SSL (HTTPS) to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
-   **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data stored in databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and file storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) will be encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption mechanisms (e.g., AES-256). This includes API keys, personal identifiable information (PII), and property data.
-   **Sensitive Data Masking/Tokenization**: For highly sensitive data (e.g., payment information if directly handled, though a payment gateway is preferred), masking or tokenization will be employed to reduce the risk of data breaches.

### 3. Application Security

-   **Input Validation and Sanitization**: All user inputs will be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection.
-   **API Security**: Rate limiting will be applied to public-facing and sensitive API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. API keys will be securely managed and rotated.
-   **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of third-party libraries and dependencies will be conducted, and vulnerabilities will be patched promptly.
-   **Error Handling and Logging**: Detailed, but non-sensitive, error logging will be implemented to aid in debugging and incident response. Error messages exposed to the client will be generic to avoid information disclosure.
-   **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection) will be implemented to mitigate various client-side attacks.

### 4. Infrastructure Security

-   **Network Segmentation**: Microservices will be deployed in isolated network segments with strict firewall rules to limit lateral movement in case of a breach.
-   **Least Privilege Principle**: All services and users will operate with the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their functions.
-   **Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing**: Regular automated vulnerability scans and periodic manual penetration tests will be conducted to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
-   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: Implemented at the network and host levels to detect and prevent malicious activities.
-   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: A centralized logging and monitoring system will be used to aggregate security events, enabling real-time threat detection and incident response.

### 5. Compliance Requirements

-   **SOC 2 Type II Preparation**: The platform will be designed and operated with the controls necessary to achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance. This involves rigorous internal controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
-   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Adherence to GDPR principles for data protection and privacy, especially for users in the EU. This includes data minimization, right to access, right to be forgotten, and data portability.
-   **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: Compliance with CCPA requirements for California residents, providing similar data rights as GDPR.
-   **Real Estate Industry Compliance**: 
    -   **MLS Data Usage**: Strict adherence to the terms of service and data usage policies of Multiple Listing Services (MLS) when scraping or integrating property data.
    -   **Fair Housing Act**: Ensuring that AI chatbot responses and property recommendations do not lead to discriminatory practices based on protected characteristics.
    -   **Lead Data Protection**: Secure handling and storage of lead information generated by the chatbots, ensuring it is only accessible to the relevant realtor and not misused.
    -   **Realtor License Verification**: Implementing a robust process for verifying and validating realtor licenses during onboarding and periodically thereafter to ensure only legitimate professionals use the platform.

### 6. Incident Response and Disaster Recovery

-   **Incident Response Plan**: A well-defined plan for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents, including communication protocols and forensic analysis.
-   **Data Backup and Recovery**: Regular, automated backups of all critical data with tested recovery procedures to ensure business continuity in case of data loss or system failure.
-   **Business Continuity Plan**: Strategies to maintain essential business functions during and after a disaster.

By implementing these comprehensive security measures and committing to ongoing compliance efforts, the Premium Real Estate AI Chatbot Platform will provide a trustworthy and secure environment for realtors and their clients, safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity. [6]
